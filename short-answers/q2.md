# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer

Examples where RegEx would be a better to use is when it comes to special characters like `@`, `$`, `%` and so on to be modify in a certain specific way. 

# Teacher Feedback

Yup! Rather than having to loop through a string and check if every character is that specific symbol.
